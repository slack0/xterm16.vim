*xterm16.txt* 16 color scheme for Vim

Description: ~
    Color scheme for a 16 color terminal. Looks best if you use xterm with
    your terminal set to |xterm-16color| (that way you get to use 24 colors!).
    Works just fine with other 8 or 16 color terminals. Defines GUI colors to
    be identical to the terminal colors.

Installation: ~
								 *xterm16.vim*
    For local installation, put the |xterm16.vim| file in your ~/.vim/colors
    directory. To install globally put it in $VIMRUNTIME/colors. Of course,
    you might want to add "colo xterm16" somewhere in your .vimrc ...

Options: ~
    |GUI_colors|	   : Customise some GUI colors (if you don't like mine)
    |xterm16_NoHtmlColors| : Disable remapping of htmlcolors.
    |xterm16_NoRemap|	   : Disable dark blue remapping on 8 color terminals
    |xterm16_TermRegexp|   : Regexp of terminals where dark blue is unreadable

Changing colors on terminals: ~
    The default colors on most terminals are often unreadable (especially dark
    blue). For help on customising colors on your favourite terminal, look
    under the appropriate section below:

	|ctheme|
	|gnome-terminal|
	|konsole|
	|rxvt|
	|xterm|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					*xterm16_NoRemap* *xterm16_TermRegexp*
    On a Linux console (and some other 8 color terminals), the dark blue
    (PreProc) is unreadable so we remap it. To disable this feature, set the
    variable |xterm16_NoRemap| in your {.vimrc}

    If this color gives you trouble on other terminals, and you want it
    changed elsewhere too set the variable |xterm16_TermRegexp| to a regexp
    matching all troublesome terminals.

								  *GUI_colors*
    If you want to change any one particular color (or all) on the GUI, just
    define the variable {g:colorname} before you load this color scheme. The
    list of colors are >
	black, darkred, darkgreen, darkyellow, darkblue, darkmagenta,
	darkcyan, grey, darkgrey, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
	white

<							*xterm16_NoHtmlColors*
    Html groups use cterm attributes (which SUCK), so we change them here. The
    GUI attributes are OK, and are unchanged. If you do not want your precious
    html groups touched, set the variable |xterm16_NoHtmlColors| in your
    {.vimrc}

    If html colors don't work correctly, set the variable |html_no_rendering|
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								       *xterm*
    |xterm| is my favourite terminal emulator. It is the only one where you
    can have a blinking cursor with the correct color! Additionally if you se
    your terminal name to *xterm-16color* you get 24 colors (16 normal colors,
    and 8 bold-ed ones). If you run into trouble with backspace / shifted
    cursor keys, see the section on |keyboard_problems|.

    The file *xterm_colors.ad* contains the application resources required to
    change the default colors in xterm (mainly to make the dark blue, and red
    colors more readable). To change the default colors on |xterm| either
    merge the contents of this file with your {.Xresources} file, or add the
    following line to your {.Xinitrc} or {.xsession}: >

	xrdb -merge xterm_colors.ad
<
    In addition to changing the default xterm colors, the file *xterm.ad* also
    changes a few other default options (including scrollbar appearance, and
    setting the default terminal name to |xterm-16color|, and setting double
    clicks to select whole URLs by default). If you like these options, use
    this file instead of |xterm_colors.ad|.

							*keyboard_problems*
    If using the |xterm-16color| terminal name gives you trouble with shifted
    cursor keys, then add the following lines to your {.vimrc}: (type the 
    as a literal escape!) >

	if($TERM == 'xterm-16color')
	    set <S-Up>=[1;2A
	    set <S-Down>=[1;2B
	    set <S-Left>=[1;2D
	    set <S-Right>=[1;2C
	    set <C-Left>=[1;5D
	    set <C-Right>=[1;5C
	endif
<
    If your system is not configured properly, and you have trouble with
    backspace, then add the following line to your .cshrc / .bash_profile: >

	stty dec
<
    Alternately to avoid these keyboard problems altogether, you can set your
    terminal name to |xterm| and add the following lines to your {.vimrc} to
    still obtain 24 colors (again remember to type  as a literal escape.) >

	if &term =~ "xterm"
	   set t_Co=16
	   set t_AB=[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{40}%+%e%p1%{92}%+%;%dm
	   set t_AF=[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{30}%+%e%p1%{82}%+%;%dm
	endif

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
									*rxvt*
    To change the default colors on rxvt, use the application resources
    provided in the file {rxvt.ad}. See the section on |xterm_colors.ad| for
    how to use this file. Rxvt accepts the terminal |xterm-16color| and
    {rxvt-16color} and you can use 24 colors! Alternately you can set the
    terminal escape sequences. NOTE: xresources must be enabled at compile
    time for this to work in rxvt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								      *ctheme*
    If necessary, change the first line of *xterm16.ct* to point to the
    correct location of ctheme, then run it with your ctheme. Thanks to
    Juhapekka Tolvanen <juhtolv@cc.jyu.fi> for providing this theme, and
    informing me of the existence of ctheme!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								     *konsole*
    To change the default colors on Konsole, add the *xterm16.schema* file to
    your .kde/share/apps/konsole directory. Select the "Xterm 16 Colors"
    schema from the schema menu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *gnome-terminal*
    If you use gnome-terminal and want to change the default colors, run
    {gconf-editor} and select the apps - gnome-terminal - profiles - Default
    menu, and change the palette option to the string (all in one line!) >

    #000000:#CD0000:#00CD00:#CDCD00:#0000FF:#CD00CD:#00CDCD:#C0C0C0:#808080:#FF0000:#00FF00:#FFFF00:#0080FF:#FF00FF:#00FFFF:#FFFFFF
<
    Note: In both |konsole| and |gnome-terminal| vim will only use 16 colors.
    The bolded colors will only be the bright colors. |xterm| and |rxvt|
    however will use bolded colors correctly provided you set the terminal to
    |xterm-16color| or set the terminal escape sequences correctly.
