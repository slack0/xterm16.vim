*xterm16.txt* 16 color Colorscheme for Vim


Description: ~

    Color scheme for a 16 color terminal. Looks best if you use xterm with
    your terminal set to "xterm-16color" (that way you get to use 24 colors!).
    Works just fine with other 8 or 16 color terminals. Defines GUI colors to
    be identical to the terminal colors.

Files: ~

    |xterm16.vim|	: Color scheme file
    |xterm16.schema|	: Color schema for Konsole
    |xterm.ad|		: Xterm Resources File
    |xterm_colors.ad|	: Xterm Resources File (colors only)
    |xterm16.txt|	: This Help file


Installation: ~
							*xterm16.vim*
    For local installation, put the "xterm16.vim" file in your ~/.vim/colors
    direcotory. To install globally put it in $VIMRUNTIME/colors. Ofcourse,
    you might want to add "colo xterm16" somewhere in your .vimrc ...

							*terminal_colors*
    Of the many terminals which support 16 colors, {xterm} is by far the best.
    However in xterm, and in most other terminal programs, some of the default
    colors are unreadable. The rest of this explains how you can customise
    your colors in |xterm|, |konsole| and |gnome-terminal|.

							*xterm*
    Best results are recieved if you use {xterm} and set the terminal name to
    {xterm-16color}. In this way, vim can use 24 colors! (16 normal colors,
    and 8 bolded ones). If you run into trouble with backspace / shifted
    cursor keys, see the section on |keyboard_problems|.
    
							*xterm_colors.ad*
    The file |xterm_colors.ad| contains the application resources required to
    change the default colors in xterm (mainly to make the darkdark blue, and
    red colors more readable). If you use xterm, and want to change it's
    default colors either merge the contents of this file with your
    {.Xresources} file, or add the following line to your {.Xinitrc} or
    {.xsession}: >

	xrdb -merge xterm_colors.ad

<   							*xterm.ad*
    In addition to changing the default xterm colors, the file |xterm.ad| also
    changes a few other default options (including scrollbar appearance, and
    setting the default terminal name to {xterm-16color}). If you like these
    options, use this file instead of |xterm_colors.ad|.

							*keyboard_problems*
    If using the {xterm-16color} terminal name gives you trouble with shifted
    cursor keys, then add the following lines to your .vimrc: (type the ^[ as
    a literal escape!) >

	if($TERM == 'xterm-16color')
	    set <S-Up>=[1;2A
	    set <S-Down>=[1;2B
	    set <S-Left>=[1;2D
	    set <S-Right>=[1;2C
	    set <C-Left>=[1;5D
	    set <C-Right>=[1;5C
	endif

<   If your system is not configured properly, and you have trouble with
    backspace, then add the following line to your .cshrc / .bash_profile: >

	stty dec
< 							*konsole*
 							*xterm16.schema*
    If you use Konsole and want to change the default konsole colors add the
    |xterm16.schema| file to your .kde/share/apps/konsole directory. Select
    the "Xterm 16 Colors" schema from the schema menu.

							*gnome-terminal*
    If you use gnome-terminal and want to change the default colors, run
    {gconf-editor} and select the apps - gnome-terminal - profiles - Default
    menu, and change the palette option to the string (all in one line!) >

    #000000:#CD0000:#00CD00:#CDCD00:#0000FF:#CD00CD:#00CDCD:#C0C0C0:#808080:#FF0000:#00FF00:#FFFF00:#0080FF:#FF00FF:#00FFFF:#FFFFFF

<   Note: In both |konsole| and |gnome-terminal| vim will only use 16 colors.
    The bolded colors will only be the bright colors. |xterm| however will use
    bolded colors correctly provided you set the terminal to {xterm-16color}.
