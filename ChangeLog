# Changelog for xterm16.vim
xterm16-2.4
    Mon 03 Apr 2006 02:53:16 PM CDT; Gautam Iyer <gautam@math.uchicago.edu>
    - Added an "allblue" colormap: This makes most foreground colors a shade
      of blue for least eyestrain.

    - Added a "softlight" colormap: This has a white background for web
      hosting / etc.

    - Added extra highlighting groups from Vim-7 (is still backward compatible
      to Vim-6.4)

xterm16-2.2
    Thu 26 May 2005 09:47:36 PM CDT; Gautam Iyer <gautam@math.uchicago.edu>
    - Added mrxvt and rxvt 256 color support (options xterm16_termtype and
      xterm16_ccube).

    - Added the program rgb_level to get the intensities of a uniform rgbi
      color cube and a patch to set the mrxvt color cube.

    - Allowed xterm16bg_Group & xterm16fg_Group to contain color names (from
      this colorscheme). Thus setting xterm16bg_Normal='none' gives
      transparency in mrxvt :)

    - A trivial perl script to generate a custom terminal 6x6x6 color cube,
      the Xresources file from xterm16_palette, and CSS files for web hosting.

    - Few minor color modifications to the soft colormap.
